1.  (/8) Exercises (from 5th edition)

    a. 3.6 [5] <§3.2> Assume 185 and 122 are unsigned 8-bit decimal integers. Calculate 185 – 122. Is there overflow, underflow, or neither?

        -  185 = 10111001
        -  122 = 01111010

    b. 3.20 [5] <§3.5> What decimal number does the bit pattern 0×0C000000 represent if it is a two’s complement integer? An unsigned integer?

    c. 3.21 [10] <§3.5> If the bit pattern 0×0C000000 is placed into the Instruction Register, what MIPS instruction will be executed?

    d. 3.22 [10] <§3.5> What decimal number does the bit pattern 0×0C000000 represent if it is a floating point number? Use the IEEE 754 standard.

    e. 3.23 [10] <§3.5> Write down the binary representation of the decimal number 63.25 assuming the IEEE 754 single precision format.
